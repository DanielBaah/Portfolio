         <p>SUMMARY: 
             Education:  MSc Sustainabilty (Current@RIT-USA )<br>
                         MSC Environmental Science (RIT-USA)<br>

               <p>I am a passionate youngman who believes that everyone is gifted to achieve a particular purpose 
                   on earth. However, many a times,we tend to divert from our devine purposes to 
                   follow or copy others which always end in teears and sorrows. My advice to the
                     youth of today is to have a positve spirit and trust in yourself. Set daily gaols
                      and work toward achieving it. Dont let anyone 
                     look down nor take you for granted. Oh no you are worth more than 
                     a living wage just build your  skills and wealth 
                     will never depart from you.</p>
                    <p> I have always strived to set examples for others to follow. I am the eldest 
                        child of poor farmers from Africa. I remember days we had to sleep on empty stomach because 
                        Dad was so broke to afford meals for the family. However, this did not deter me from pursuing 
                        my dreams in the United States. I borrowed from colleagues to take the GRE exams.  Some tried 
                        to make fun of me when i declared my intentions to study abroad all because we are poor. But today 
                        i hold 2 advance degrees from one of the best colleges in the US and run my own educational 
                        consultancy. I am maried with 2 handsome boys and live in NY State. </p>
                     <p>In conclusion, you have the power to change the world so dont let your current 
                         circumstance define your future for you. Life is full  of battles but we shall overcome 
                         them all.  HAVE A NICE DAY  by Danny !</p>
